He looked at her NOUN, and without hesitation, he VERBed their NOUNs.
My NOUN was acting a bit ADJ, so I decided to VERB it.
To the surprise of everyone, the NOUN happened yesterday, but it didn't VERB as expected.
When he VERBed my NOUN, I sensed a ADJ NOUN coming from my NOUN.
To VERB a NOUN, one must first VERB their NOUN.
The ADJ NOUN jumped over the ADJ NOUN.
